Correlation between demographic factors and covid vaccination rates

Over 2 years ago since the initial COVID-19 breakdout, we are still experiencing the developement of variants and the rapid and deadly spread of the virus, despite the development of vaccines. 
Why are we seeing such varried vaccination rates throughout the USA, from state to state. 

The project seeks to answer the question of what demographic & geographic features are directly correlated with higher or lower vaccination rates.
